# simple-alphapets-learning-website-

### -In this project, you are required to implement a simple web application that allows kids in schools to learn the basic English Alphabet.The basic idea is that, the user will choose the number of letters he wants to learn, and when clicking on each letter, an image will be of something that begins with that letter. In addition, some user interaction events are collected and stored in the localStorage object of the browser to be used in subsequent versions of the project.
